<!-- <p>Welcome to the Oxford Metadata Registry and Repository (OMR) ISO/IEC11179 compliant metadata registry and vocabulary management system.</p> -->
            <p>The OMR ISO/IEC11179-compliant web application is a resource where the meaning and allowed values of
            measurements are declared by linking terms in controlled vocabularies  to value domains restricting the values that may be assigned through the
            declaration of <i>data elements</i>
            </p>
            <p>You can browse data elements which are used in different XML artifacts, applications
            and databases. You can see how they are related to one another and how different data elements combine and are used as structures
            within different systems. You can also view and can contribute to the definitions for 
            <a href="datatypeAdd">datatypes</a> used in different systems within various test resources at Oxford. </p>
            <p>By reusing and sharing data elements you can ensure that data you collect and distribute is interoperable
            with other Communities of Interest. The OMR is currently being tested with a number of datasets from different communities of interest (COI). 
                        <p>You can view (and can contribute to) the definitions for 
            <a href="measurementsAdd">measurements of interest</a> to engineers and scientists within the research group here.   </p>
                        <p>You can also view (and can contribute to) the definitions for 
            <a href="../edit/supported_datatype.xql">datatypes</a> use within different systems within Oxford.   </p>

                        <p>If you want to load large datatype definitions - from UML diagrams or XSD files, there are a number of tools which can help in 
            loading large quantities of meta-data. Please get in touch with

                        </p>
                        <p>You can <a href="searchText">search for text</a> within the names and definitions, inspect the underlying <a href="showModel">data model of the repository</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>We are currently working on a REST interface which will then be available for access via a variety of addons and utilities</p>
